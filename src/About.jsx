      <p>
        Our NGO ensures that elders live with dignity and respect. We provide medical support, food, shelter, and community care programs.
        HelpAge India is a secular, not-for-profit organisation in India, registered under the Societies' Registration Act of 1860. Set up in 1978, the organisation works for 'the cause and care of disadvantaged older persons to improve their quality of life'. It runs healthcare, agecare, livelihood, disaster response and awareness initiatives throughout the country & advocates strongly for the elder cause. It became the first and only Indian organization to be honoured with the 'UN Population Award 2020' for its exemplary work in the field of ageing and population issues, and earlier in 2014, has been the recipient of 'Vayoshreshtha Samman' by Government of India, as an institution working for senior citizens.

HelpAge India's motto is 'Fighting isolation, poverty and neglect.
